# MitoEdit: a tool for targeted mitochondrial base editing

## About
**MitoEdit** is a novel Python workflow designed for targeted base editing of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). This tool streamlines the selection of optimal targeting windows for base editing, helping researchers efficiently target mtDNA mutations that are linked to various diseases. By enabling targeted base editing of the mitochondrial genome, MitoEdit will speed up the study of mtDNA-related diseases, help with preclinical drug testing, and enable therapeutic approaches to correct pathogenic mutations.

## Overview
MitoEdit lets users input DNA sequences in text format, specify the target base position, and indicate the desired modification. The tool processes this information to identify candidate target windows, list the number and position of potential bystander edits, and find optimal flanking TALE sequences, where applicable. All the results are provided in a structured format including detailed logs to track progress.

### Pipelines
The current MitoEdit workflow established four different pipelines based on the editing patterns observed in the following base editor systems: 
1. [Mok2020_G1333](https://rdcu.be/dXUIG)
2. [Mok2020_G1397](https://rdcu.be/dXUIG)
3. [Mok2022_G1397_DddA11](https://rdcu.be/dXUIm)
4. [Cho_sTALEDs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867422003890)

A detailed description for each pipeline can be found in the [README](pipelines/README.md) file in the *pipelines* folder.

**Note**: To use the evolved DddA6 variant from the [Mok 2022 paper](https://rdcu.be/dXUIm), you can use the `Mok2020_G1397` pipeline.

### TALE-NT Tool
The workflow uses the [TALE-NT tool](https://tale-nt.cac.cornell.edu/) to identify optimal flanking TALE arrays around each candidate target window.

## Quick Start
If you have all the necessary tools installed, you can use these commands to access MitoEdit:

#### For targeting the human mitochondrial DNA:
```
python mitocraft.py <position> <reference_base> <mutant_base>
```
**Note:** The `position` is based on the [human mitochondrial genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/251831106) sequence (NC_012920.1)

#### For targeting any other DNA sequence:
```
python mitocraft.py --input_file <input_DNA_file> <position> <reference_base> <mutant_base>
```

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - `pandas` 
  - `openpyxl`
- Download and install [Conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) if not already installed. Follow the prompts to complete installation.

## Installation

#### 1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Kundu-Lab/mitoedit.git
cd mitoedit
```
#### 2. Set up the Conda environment:
* Use the provided `environment.yml` file to create the Conda environment:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
- Alternatively, you can create the conda environment manually:
```
conda create -n run_talen_env python=2.7.18 biopython=1.70
```
**Note:** The Conda environment should be named `run_talen_env` for MitoEdit to correctly use the TALE-NT tool. There is no need to activate the conda environment, as the pipeline will automatically use `run_talen_env` if it is installed in Conda. This environment is specifically for the TALE-NT Tool.

## Web Interface

MitoEdit includes a web interface that makes it easy to analyze DNA sequences through your browser. Here's how to set it up:

### System Requirements
- Python 3.10 or newer
- Conda

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Create environments for web server and TALE-NT tool
conda env create -f web-environment.yml
conda env create -f talen-environment.yml
```

2. **Run the Web Server**
```bash
# Start the web server
conda run -n mitoedit-web python web/main.py
```

The web interface will be available at http://localhost:8000, where you can:
- Input DNA sequence position and bases
- Upload custom DNA sequence files
- View and download analysis results in Excel format

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
- Check the terminal output for error messages
- Review the log file: `logging_main.log`
- Ensure both `mitoedit-web` and `run_talen_env` environments are properly created
- Verify all required files and directories exist

### Docker Installation

MitoEdit is also available as a Docker container, which provides an isolated environment with all dependencies pre-installed.

#### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system ([Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))

#### Building and Running with Docker

1. **Build the Docker image:**
```bash
sudo docker build -t mitoedit .
```

2. **Run the container:**
```bash
sudo docker run -p 80:80 mitoedit
```

The web interface will be available at http://localhost:80

#### Docker Troubleshooting
- Ensure Docker is running on your system
- Check if port 80 is available (if not, you can map to a different port using `-p 8000:80` for example)
- If you encounter permission issues, ensure you have the necessary privileges to run Docker commands

## What input parameters does MitoEdit require?
MitoEdit requires the following parameters:
### Required Data Parameters: 

#### 1. **Position**: The position of the base to target (1-based index).

#### 2. **Reference Base**: The original base at the specified position (A, T, C, or G).

#### 3. **Mutant Base**: The desired base conversion (A, T, C, or G).

### Optional Data Parameter:
#### Input File:
- The path to a file (.txt / .fasta) containing the DNA sequence. 
- If not provided, MitoEdit will use the [human mtDNA sequence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/251831106) from NCBI by default.

## What does MitoEdit output?
MitoEdit generates the following outputs:

### Output Directories
MitoEdit organizes the output files in the following directories:
- fasta: Contains the FASTA file of the 60bp sequence adjacent to the target base.

**Note**: When optimal flanking TALE sequences are found, the sequence is added to the `LeftTALE` and `RightTALE` columns respectively. The impact of bystander edits is not provided when using an input DNA file.

## Notes
- **Input File Formatting**: Ensure that your input file is correctly formatted, with the reference base matching the base at the specified position.
- **Supported File Formats**: MitoEdit can read `.fasta` and `.txt` formats for DNA sequences.
- **Minimum Upload Sequence Length**: The input file must contain at least 35 bases, covering the target base on either side, for accurate processing.
- **Output File Name Conflicts**: Check for existing output files with the same name before running MitoEdit to prevent overwriting and errors.
- **Logging:** MitoEdit logs its progress and any issues encountered during execution in `logging_main.log.`
- **Species Support**: While the tool is designed primarily for human mtDNA, other DNA sequences can also be uploaded and used.
- **Modifying TALE-NT Workflow**: If no matching flanking TALE sequences are identified, consider modifying the TALE-NT parameter by setting `FILTER = 2`. This will identify all TALE pairs targeting any base in the target window, not just those for the target base. For further information, refer to the [TALE-NT FAQs](https://tale-nt.cac.cornell.edu/faqs).
